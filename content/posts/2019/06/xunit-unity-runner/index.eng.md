Hello, I'm Hong Minhee, [Libplanet] committer at Planetarium. 
In this post, I want to talk about why we came to a conclusion to run unit tests on Unity too, 
the most widely used game engine, and how we actually approached it.

Supporting Different Environments on Libplanet
---------------------------------------

Libplanet is a common library that solves game implementation problems such as P2P communication and 
data synchronization when creating online multiplayer games that run on distributed P2P.

Automated tests, especially unit tests, are needed to achieve rapid improvement while minimizing malfunctions 
that are prone to [regressions] or corner cases. Furthermore, Libplanet is a library and because it is 
difficult to determine which operating system and .NET runtime each game or app will use, we need to run all 
tests in as many different environments as possible.

So our team had run tests on [Azure Pipelines][^1] with (Linux, macOS, Windows) × (.NET Framework, Mono, .NET Core) 
combination[^2] whenever a push or a pull request was made in the Libplanet repository.

Unity ≠ Mono
------------

At first, we thought this was enough because Unity uses Mono Runtime. But as we used Libplanet to develop 
our game on Unity, we had to encounter unexpected behaviors in the game several times, and it became increasingly 
evident that just passing the test on Mono was not enough.

[In fact, the Mono used in Unity seems to be a fairly long-standing downstream, with a lot of patches added 
to the upstream.][unity-mono] And even if they were tested at the exact same Mono runtime, there were a lot 
of special conditions created by Unity Player. For instance, [NetMQ], [ZeroMQ]'s C# implementation, had 
numerous library malfunctions due to many complicated things happening inside compared to the simplicity of 
the APIs revealed on the outer layer.

All of these considerations led to an agreement that a testing environment for Unity needed to be added to CI 
to ensure reliable functionality.

Testing xUnit.net on Unity
--------------------------

Because there is a unit testing feature available in Unity, we tried to use it at first. Unfortunately, Unity's 
unit testing was done in an Editor environment used by game developers, not in a Player environment, and the 
testing framework supported only [NUnit]. We thought about changing all of Libplanet's [xUnit.net]-based test 
codes, to NUnit, but with such a high volume of codes to change at once, we didn't want to risk making mistakes 
that are hard to notice.

So we decided to create a test runner app instead of a game app with Unity. Fortunately, xUnit.net was well divided 
between APIs for writing tests and APIs for running tests. This is probably due to the diverse frontend plug-ins to 
various IDE, GUI and CLI. In fact, if you search "xunit runner" on NuGet, you'll get a xUnit.net test runner for a 
variety of environments.

A downside is that because there are no API documents, we had to search the source code of xUnit.net and the source 
code of other test runners.[^3]

The test runner API on xUnit.net is roughly as follows: First, the client code looks for test classes and the tests 
methods within those classes from the assembly files (*.dll*) passed through the input. After, the client code can 
decide which test to run. Then, the test cases are run by the test runner. Because the test discovery and execution 
can be done in parallel for performance, the API follows a typical [<abbr title="inversion of control">IoC</abbr>][IoC] 
pattern. An interface called [`IMessageSinkWithTypes`][IMessageSinkWithTypes], which receives events such as test 
discovery, start running, failure, success, skip, and so on in the form of a message, must be implemented in the client 
code to show the log on screen when such events occur. Because our team didn't run the tests in parallel, it was quite 
frustrating to have a less liberal API with a lengthy client code. 🙄

Building a <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> with Unity
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our greatest concern when creating a Unity test runner was that since this was to be done on 
<abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr> in the first place, we believed that the test runner had to be manipulated 
by the <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> rather than by the graphics screen, and the results should be 
visible. So with Unity being a platform for making graphic games, we were worried whether it'd be a good idea or not to 
actually create a CLI app.

Fortunately, we found out that Unity has a <dfn>headless mode</dfn>, which means that all logs taken in 
[`Debug.Log()`][Debug.Log] method are output as [standard output][stdout], without graphical display.

caption="<q>Server Build</q> option in Unity build settings that turn on headless mode"
>}}

Even if you don't use the `Debug.Log()` method provided by Unity, we've also figured out that just like creating a 
typical application the [`Console`][Console] class provided by the .NET standard works as well.

However, since the `Main()` method cannot be defined, the command line factor was not accepted as the `string[] args`
parameter of the `Main()` method, but instead had to be obtained as the [`Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()`][GetCommandLineArgs] 
method. Similarly, the program's termination required an explicit call to the [`Application.Quit()`][Quit] method to 
terminate the process directly.

Lastly, there were messages being output from Unity player itself, but we couldn't find a way to block it, so we had 
to wrap it up.[^4]

Build Automation
----------------

Building a CLI app with Unity and writing a document on how to build one on Windows as well as Linux or macOS makes 
the process tricky and easier for people to get inconsistent results. So we decided to make a tag in the repository 
and when pushed, and it'll automatically build for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Although we thought about putting CI on the board, we decided that it was unnecessary and used [GitHub Actions] to build it.

[Referring to Kawai Yoshifumi's post][5], we were able to carry out the entire build process inside the Docker. 
In the process, we experienced things that we hadn't experienced in other environments:

Because Unity was a commercial product, we needed to activate the license.

Unity has somewhat an ambiguous boundary between an editor and a player. The code that will run in the editor environment 
can also be scripted, and this enables the app to be built by itself because Unity includes the app-building script as 
part of the app and then runs it. 

At first, we thought we needed to build on all three operating systems, but fortunately, Unity supported [cross-compiling][6] 
and we were able to build the app for macOS and Windows on Linux.

Conclusion
----------

The newly built xUnit.net test runner for Unity has been applied on Libplanet project and is currently working well. 
By working well, we mean that the tests are often breaking due to
different actions that are only seen in Unity environments. 😇 Of course, we're glad to accept it because that's the 
point of building a unit test-- to find bugs as early as possible.

The runner is not yet neatly organized, but we have still [put it up as an open source on GitHub][7]. The executable 
file is available on the [release page][8], so if you want to try it out, it's all yours!

[^1]: As of June 2019, <abbr title= “continuous integration”>CI</abbr> services that support all Linux, macOS, and Windows include [Travis CI] and Azure Pipelines. Our team used Travis CI at first, but it didn't perform well, so we're now using Azure Pipelines. 
[^2]: Because the .NET Framework supports only Windows, it will be tested in 7 environments instead of 9. 
[^3]: Because the .NET <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr> has become very common for quite some time, there are many projects that don't post API documents on the Web and simply leave [XML document annotations][xmldoc] in the source code. Those annotations will appear small as a tooltip when the class or method is automatically completed in IDE.
